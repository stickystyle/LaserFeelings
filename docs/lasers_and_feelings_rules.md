### 3. Number (2-5)
Your single stat representing your **LASERS vs FEELINGS balance**:

| Number | LASERS Ability | FEELINGS Ability | Description |
|--------|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| **2** | Excellent | Terrible | You're a logic machine (like Spock) |
| **3** | Good | Poor | You lean toward rationality |
| **4** | Poor | Good | You lean toward passion |
| **5** | Terrible | Excellent | You're all emotion and instinct (like Kirk) |

**LASERS** represents:
- Technology, science, engineering

- Calm, precise, calculated action

**FEELINGS** represents:
- Intuition, gut instinct, empathy
- Diplomacy, seduction, passion
- Wild, impulsive, emotional action

### 4. Name
Give your character a cool space adventure name (e.g., "Sparks McGee", "Zara-7", "Commander Steele")

### 5. Goal
What your character wants to accomplish. Choose one or create your own:
- Become Captain
- Meet New Aliens
- Shoot Bad Guys

---

## Ship Creation

The crew collectively defines the **Raptor** with:

### Two Strengths (choose 2):
- **Fast**: High speed, can outrun pursuers
- **Nimble**: Agile maneuvering, dodges well
- **Well-Armed**: Powerful weapons systems
- **Powerful Shields**: Strong defensive systems
- **Superior Sensors**: Excellent detection and scanning
- **Cloaking Device**: Can become invisible

- **Only One Medical Pod**: And Captain Darcy is in it
- **Horrible Circuit Breakers**: In battle, consoles tend to explode on the bridge
- **Grim Reputation**: Captain Darcy did some bad stuff in the past

**Important**: Ship strengths and problems are **purely narrative**. They don't provide dice bonuses or penalties. They create fictional situations and complications for the GM to use in storytelling.

---

## Core Dice Mechanic

When you attempt something **risky or uncertain**, you roll dice to determine the outcome.

### Step 1: Determine Task Type

The GM determines if the task uses **LASERS** or **FEELINGS**:

**LASERS tasks** (roll UNDER your number):
- Repairing damaged systems
- Analyzing sensor data
- Hacking computer systems
- Making precise calculations
- Operating technical equipment
- Acting with cold logic

**FEELINGS tasks** (roll OVER your number):
- Negotiating with aliens
- Reading someone's emotions
- Seducing or charming
- Acting on instinct
- Taking bold, impulsive action
- Leading or inspiring others

### Step 2: Build Your Dice Pool

**Base**: 1d6 (always)

**+1d6 if PREPARED**:
- You described preparation in the fiction before rolling
- You brought the right tools or equipment
- You took time to set things up properly
- **GM determines** based on what you said/did

**+1d6 if EXPERT**:
- Your **Role** matches the task being attempted
- Examples:
  - Engineer repairing → Expert
  - Soldier shooting → Expert
  - Envoy negotiating → Expert
  - Pilot flying → Expert
  - Doctor healing → Expert
  - Scientist analyzing → Expert
  - Explorer scouting → Expert
- **GM determines** based on your Role

**+1d6 per successful HELPER**:
- Another character helps you
- They describe how they help
- They make their own roll
- If they succeed (get at least 1 success), you get +1d6
- If they fail, they don't help (no penalty, GM may adjust narration)
- **Multiple helpers can stack** (no limit)

**Maximum base dice**: 3d6 (1 base + 1 prepared + 1 expert)
**With helpers**: Can exceed 3d6 (e.g., 3d6 + 2 helpers = 5d6)

### Step 3: Roll and Count Successes

Roll all your dice and compare **each die** to your number:

**For LASERS tasks**:
- Each die showing **less than** your number = 1 success
- Example: Number 3, LASERS task, roll [1, 2, 5] → 2 successes (1 and 2)

**For FEELINGS tasks**:
- Each die showing **greater than** your number = 1 success
- Example: Number 3, FEELINGS task, roll [1, 4, 5] → 2 successes (4 and 5)

**Special: LASER FEELINGS**:
- If **any die** shows **exactly your number** → LASER FEELINGS
- Even if multiple dice match, you only get **one LASER FEELINGS trigger**
- See special rules below

### Step 4: Interpret Results

| Successes | Outcome | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **0** | **Failure** | It goes wrong. The GM says how things get worse. The situation changes for the worse. |
| **1** | **Partial Success** | You barely manage it. The GM inflicts a complication, harm, or cost. You succeed, but there's a downside. |
| **2** | **Full Success** | You do it well. Good job! Clean success with no complications. |
| **3+** | **Critical Success** | You get a critical success! The GM tells you some extra effect you get. Extra information, bonus advantage, etc. |

**Important**: The situation **always changes** after a roll, for good or ill. Never roll and have nothing happen.

## LASER FEELINGS Special Mechanic

When you roll **exactly your number** on any die:

### What Happens:
1. **Stop the resolution** (don't resolve success/failure yet)
2. You have **LASER FEELINGS** - a special moment of clarity
3. **Ask the GM one question** and they must answer honestly
4. The exact match **counts as 1 success**
5. You can **change your action** if you want based on the answer
6. **Re-roll** with your new (or same) action

### Even if Multiple Dice Match:
- If you roll [3, 3, 4] with number 3, you only get **one question**
- Multiple exact matches don't give multiple questions

### Good Questions to Ask:
- What are they really feeling?
- Who's behind this?
- How could I get them to \_\_\_\_\_?
- What should I be on the lookout for?
- What's the best way to \_\_\_\_\_?
- What's really going on here?

### Example:
**Zara-7 (Engineer, Number 2)** scans for energy signatures with her tricorder.

She's an expert (Scientist role) and prepared (described setting up the scan), so she rolls **3d6** for a LASERS task (needs to roll under 2).

**Roll**: [1, 2, 5]
- 1 < 2 → Success
- 2 = 2 → **LASER FEELINGS!**
- 5 > 2 → Fail

She stops. "GM, what should I be on the lookout for?"

GM answers: "The energy signature has the same pattern as a Void Cultist trap."

She changes her action: "I'm not scanning anymore—I'm warning the crew and backing away from this location!"

She re-rolls with a new action.

## Helping Mechanic

### How to Help:
1. Say **how you help** in the fiction
2. Make your own roll (build your dice pool normally)
3. If you get **at least 1 success**, give the helped character **+1d6**
4. If you **fail**, you don't help (but no negative consequences unless GM narrates them)

### Multiple Helpers:
- **Can stack infinitely**
- Each successful helper adds +1d6
- Example: Main character has 3d6, two friends help successfully → roll 5d6

### When 4+ Successes:
- Rolling more than 3 successes **doesn't improve the outcome** beyond critical success
- It just makes success more likely

## Important Clarifications for AI Players

### When the GM Asks "What Do You Do?"
This is a **decision point**. You should:
1. State your character's **intent** (what you want to accomplish)
2. Describe your **approach** (how you do it)
3. Wait for the GM to call for a roll or narrate the outcome

### Narrating Outcomes vs. Stating Intent
**Good (stating intent)**:
- "I try to shoot the alien with my phase pistol"
- "I attempt to charm the ambassador into giving us access"
- "I want to repair the damaged console"

**Bad (narrating outcome)**:
- "I shoot the alien and it dies" ❌
- "I charm the ambassador and they give us access" ❌
- "I fix the console and it works now" ❌

**The GM controls all outcomes.** Players only state what they **attempt** to do.

### When to Roll
- **GM calls for the roll**, not you
- Only roll when the outcome is **uncertain and risky**
- Don't roll for trivial actions or guaranteed successes

### Dice Pool Communication
When the GM asks you to roll, they'll tell you:
- How many dice to roll (based on prepared/expert status)
- Whether it's a LASERS or FEELINGS task
- What you're rolling for

Example: "You're an expert at this and you're prepared, so roll 3d6. This is a LASERS task, so you want to roll under your number."

## Example Play Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Repairing the Ship

**Character**: Zara-7 (Android Engineer, Number 2)
**Situation**: The ship's engines are damaged after a firefight
**Action**: "I want to repair the engines so we can jump to warp"

**GM**: "This is a LASERS task—technical work. You're an Engineer so you're an expert, and you've got your tools ready so you're prepared. Roll 3d6 and try to roll under your number, which is 2."

**Player rolls**: [1, 3, 6]
- 1 < 2 → Success ✓
- 3 > 2 → Fail
- 6 > 2 → Fail

**Result**: 1 success (partial success)

**GM**: "You manage to get the engines online, but you had to bypass several safety protocols to do it quickly. The engines are running hot—if you push them too hard, they might overload. But you can make the jump to warp now."

---

### Scenario 2: Negotiating with Pirates

**Character**: Commander Steele (Hot-Shot Envoy, Number 4)
**Situation**: Space pirates have surrounded the ship
**Action**: "I want to talk our way out of this. I open a comm channel and try to convince them we're not worth the trouble"

**GM**: "This is a FEELINGS task—you're using charm and persuasion. You're an Envoy so you're an expert, but you didn't prepare for this encounter. Roll 2d6 and try to roll over your number, which is 4."

**Player rolls**: [4, 5]
- 4 = 4 → **LASER FEELINGS!** ✓
- 5 > 4 → Success ✓

**GM**: "You rolled exactly your number! You have LASER FEELINGS. You can ask me a question."

**Player**: "What are they really feeling?"

**GM**: "They're scared. Their ship is damaged and they're desperate for supplies and a way out. They're bluffing about their strength."

**Player**: "Okay, I'm changing my approach. Instead of just talking our way out, I offer them medical supplies and safe passage to a neutral station in exchange for letting us go."

**GM**: "Nice! Re-roll with that new approach."

**Player rolls**: [2, 6]
- 2 < 4 → Fail
- 6 > 4 → Success ✓

**Result**: 1 success (partial success, but the LASER FEELINGS die also counted, so 2 total)

**GM**: "They agree, but their captain insists on coming aboard to verify you have the medical supplies before they'll let you leave. What do you do?"

---

### Scenario 3: Combat with Help

**Character 1**: Kira (Dangerous Soldier, Number 3) - shooting
**Character 2**: Sparks (Savvy Engineer, Number 2) - helping

**Situation**: A hostile alien is charging at the crew
**Action (Kira)**: "I shoot it with my phase pistol!"
**Action (Sparks)**: "I help by quickly recalibrating her weapon's targeting system!"

**GM**: "Kira, you're a Soldier shooting, so you're an expert. This is a LASERS task—calm, precise shooting. Roll 2d6 under your 3. But first, Sparks, roll to see if you successfully help. You're an Engineer with tools, so you're an expert and prepared. Roll 3d6 under your 2."

**Sparks rolls**: [1, 2, 4]
- 1 < 2 → Success ✓
- 2 = 2 → LASER FEELINGS ✓
- 4 > 2 → Fail

**Result**: 2 successes (full success)

**GM**: "Sparks, you also got LASER FEELINGS. Want to ask a question or just re-roll?"

**Sparks**: "I'll ask: What's the best way to take this thing down?"

**GM**: "You notice its hide is thickest on the front but thin near the leg joints. Aiming there would be more effective."

**Sparks**: "I keep my action the same—I successfully help Kira by telling her to aim for the legs!"

**GM**: "Great! Kira, since Sparks succeeded, you get +1d6. Roll 3d6 total, under your 3."

**Kira rolls**: [1, 2, 5]
- 1 < 3 → Success ✓
- 2 < 3 → Success ✓
- 5 > 3 → Fail

**Result**: 2 successes (full success)

**GM**: "You fire a precise shot into the alien's leg joint. It collapses with a shriek, stunned and unable to chase you. You've got a clear path to escape now!"
