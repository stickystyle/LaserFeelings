(No dice suggestion displayed - this is pure roleplay with no mechanical task)


Notes:
------
- The DM sees all justifications and can approve/deny the suggested bonus dice
- Maximum 3d6 total (1 base + up to 2 bonuses)
- If helping another character, their name is displayed (resolved from character_id)
- The checkmark (✓) indicates a bonus is being requested
- DM still has final say on whether to accept the suggestions
