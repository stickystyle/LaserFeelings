# Specification Quality Checklist: AI TTRPG Player System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: October 18, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (2 present in Dependencies section)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

### Items Requiring Resolution:

1. **[NEEDS CLARIFICATION] Virtual Tabletop Integration** (Dependencies section, line 256)
   - **Question**: Should the system integrate with existing virtual tabletop platforms (Roll20, Foundry VTT) or operate as standalone command-line tool?
   - **Impact**: Affects architecture, user interface requirements, and development complexity
   - **Answer**: Standalone CLI tool (no Roll20/Foundry dependencies)

2. **[NEEDS CLARIFICATION] Dice Rolling** (Dependencies section, line 257)
   - **Question**: Should dice rolling be handled by external dice bot/roller or built into the system?
   - **Impact**: Affects dependencies, integration requirements, and DM workflow
   - **Answer**: Built-in D&D 5e notation parser

**Action Required**: These clarifications should be addressed before proceeding to `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`. However, they are dependency-level questions rather than core feature requirements, so the specification is otherwise complete and ready for refinement.
